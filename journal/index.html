            <h2>Best Practices for Modal Windows</h2>
            <date>February 6, 2023</date>

            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    I have a habit of using modals and overlays in most of my designs, so I was surprised to find that they should actually be used as a last resort. A modal may disrupt the user experience by taking attention away from the main task on the page. Or, it might also be immedsiately dismissed as an ad. Instead, modals should only be used when grabbing the user’s attention, requesting user input, or showing additional information.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    All modals should also have a way to exit, a title, clear CTAs, and be properly sized and placed on the page. In terms of interactions, modals should be the only element in focus on the page, and only show up after a user action. Most of these pieces seem common sense, but I often catch modals missing a few things as I’m iterating on my designs or critiquing other’s. Without one of these elements, the modal looks a bit lacking. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something I didn’t know was that mobile modals are not recommended due to sizing accessbility issues. I am definitely guitly of including modals in my mobile designs, so I will be more careful the next time I’m designing on mobile screens. I’m curious as to what modal alternatives there are for mobile screens.

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date>January 28, 2023</date>

            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    The design of forms is more nuanced than I thought. Most of the things mentioned in the article were fairly simple, but were also extremely effective in elevating a form’s user experience and accessibility. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something that stood out to me was the best practices with input labels. I hadn’t thought of the consequences of including an inline label or placeholder text and what would happen if users were to use that input field. I also didn’t realize that making forms tab-ready had to be manually done as I had assumed that all forms would accommodate users using the tab key to get to the next input field. I was surprised to learn that the double password input was not giving users the option to view their passwords to look for mistakes. Despite how simple forms are, a lot of thought must go into their creation to make sure they’re user-friendly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One example of good form design is <a href="https://www.typeform.com/templates/t/simple-registration/">Typeform</a>, a site that lets you create minimalistic surveys and questionnaires using their site’s template. Their forms follows the auto-focus principle by showing only one input field at a time. They also show users which question they’re on out of the form’s total, thus incentivizing them to complete the form. 
                </p>
