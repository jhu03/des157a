                        <p>
                            The design of forms is more nuanced than I thought. Most of the things mentioned in the article were fairly simple, but were also extremely effective in elevating a form’s user experience and accessibility. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Something that stood out to me was the best practices with input labels. I hadn’t thought of the consequences of including an inline label or placeholder text and what would happen if users were to use that input field. I also didn’t realize that making forms tab-ready had to be manually done as I had assumed that all forms would accommodate users using the tab key to get to the next input field. I was surprised to learn that the double password input was not giving users the option to view their passwords to look for mistakes. Despite how simple forms are, a lot of thought must go into their creation to make sure they’re user-friendly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One example of good form design is <a href="https://www.typeform.com/templates/t/simple-registration/">Typeform</a>, a site that lets you create minimalistic surveys and questionnaires using their site’s template. Their forms follows the auto-focus principle by showing only one input field at a time. They also show users which question they’re on out of the form’s total, thus incentivizing them to complete the form. 
                        </p>
