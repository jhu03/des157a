    <h1>Final Composition</h1>

    <h2>Composition Overview</h2>
    <p>The page will be split into two views: Player 1 and Player 2. The split screen will have a darkened overlay depending on who's turn it is. 
    </p>    

    <p>Blocks will appear at varying positions on top of the previously placed block. Ideally, only one block appears at a time and would be dropping down from the top of the screen. However, due to time constraints, I will only be focusing on making blocks appear one at a time.</p>


    <div id="compBg">
        <div>
                <h2>Graphic Components</h2>
                <p>
                    This image will be the background for both gameplay screens. As blocks fill up the page, the image and screen would shift upwards to accomodate for the growing tower. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to add some animations on top of this image to make the screen more dynamic. For example, I can have clouds or planes slowly moving across the screen at the top of the image where the graphics are more scarce. I also want to have the finish/goal line be animated as a moving marquee to make completing the game more exciting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also will be creating different block types so the blocks that are placed will be randomized on each block generation. Again, this makes the game more visually interesting with the element of surprise on each block generated.
