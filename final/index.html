    <h1>Final Brief</h1>

    <div id="summary">
            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I will be updating my Game On! Project to be more visually appealing and interactive by adding more interaction feedback and advanced Javascript techniques.
    </p>    
    </div>


    <h2>Project Goals</h2>

    <p>
        My goal for this project is to <strong>make my game more game-like</strong> with advanced interactions and intractability. Currently, my Game On! Project is very barebones, but I want to take it a step further so it matches the quality of my other studio projects. In addition to improving the look and feel of this project, I want to <strong>learn more Javascript techniques</strong>, especially scrolling interactions and functions. I was able to experiment with these concepts in my Every Picture project and in the class examples, but I didn’t get to fully explore and implement them in my designs. I hope that with this final project, I will be able to learn how to use them effectively by figuring out how to apply them on my own. 
    </p>


    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>
        I want my project to have a <strong>fun, arcade-like theme</strong> to match the tower-stacking aspect of the game. Tower-stacking is one of the classic games of Flash and arcades, so I want to use a <strong>retro color scheme with arcade fonts and aesthetics</strong>. This means incorporating a pixel-style throughout my project by creating pixel graphics and using pixel fonts. But, pixel art is quite sharp and would make my project look dated, which is not something I am going for. To modernize the pixel-art design, instead of using pixel art directly, I would be sticking with <strong>vector illustrations of objects that are cube and square-like</strong>. The square-shapes keep the arcade game aesthetic by following a design similar to Mario World while also keeping my designs cohesive throughout the project.
    </p>


    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
    <p>
        I plan to <strong>incorporate more haptic feedback</strong> into my design. For example, buttons will change colors and orientation on hover to indicate that the button is clickable. Some of the buttons, like the Pass button, will have aural feedback when clicked to further the game-like aspect of the project. The most complex aspect I want to implement is an <strong>image background that scrolls as more blocks are added to the screen</strong>. I’m not sure how I will achieve this, nor am I sure how I would determine when the background should scroll back up. To do this, I assume I would add a figure that is overly zoomed in and set it to position absolute. I would then add an event listener or a if-then statement for modus to detect the number of blocks on the screen. When the blocks reach a certain number or percentage height of the screen, the image would move upwards by a certain amount. To make the experience more customizable, I would also ask for <strong>user inputs</strong> so players can customize their game names.

    </p>
   
    
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>
        I want users of my project to have <strong>fun and enjoy the interactive experience</strong> with my project. One of the goals for this project is to invoke <strong>a sense of competition and nostalgia</strong> for arcade games. The current design of my project meets the competition aspect by showing both players each other’s scores and visually showing them how close the other person is to reaching the finish line. The nostalgia factor will be achieved once my graphics and visuals are more developed. To bring a sense of delight to my users, I will further develop my micro-interactions as well. This includes button interactions, aural feedback, and aesthetic visuals that relate to the visual narrative.
