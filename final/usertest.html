    <h2>Animation Timing</h2>
    <p>Players tend to <strong>click "Build Again" before the building animation ends</strong>. This causes the tower to continue growing before the player can see where the tower ends/ where the latest block is placed, and this lack of user feedback can cause confusion.
    </p>   
    
    <h2>Goal Confusion</h2>
    <p>A few of my players were confused <strong>what the finish line meant</strong>. Did players have to reach the line to win or go over it? One player suggested removing the finish line entirely, and to just state how many blocks are needed to win the game. 
    </p>  

    <p>A few platers were also confused whether or not they were rolling one or two die, and if snake eyes were involved. This is a sign that I might need to <strong>clarify my instruction to reflect the differences of my game from the Game of Pig</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Game Setup and UI</h2>
    <p>All my players liked the game setup with the <strong>game divider overlay</strong>. They said it helped focus the players on one side of the screen and informs users whose turn it is.
    </p>  

    <p>They also <strong>enjoyed the visual aesthetic</strong> of the game. The colors and typography work well together and reminds them of computer games.
